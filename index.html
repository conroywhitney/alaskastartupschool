        <h2>FAQ</h2>

        <h3>Why/How is Alaska Startup School FREE?</h3>
        <p>We believe in the <b>"Give First"</b> philosophy -- that we as a Startup Community are stroger when we support each other. Learning how to validate startup ideas leads to more and better startups, which leads to a more vibrant ecosystem for everyone. Our <b>sponsors</b> support our mission by covering some of the operational costs.</p>

        <h3>What if I can't attend all of the weekly calls?</h3>
        <p>There is no pass/fail. You're not being graded. That said, the bulk of this program is the part that you do on your own time. Demonstrating that, and learning from your peer group, is a vital part of the cirriculum. If you know ahead of time that you won't be available for a number of video calls, it may be better to wait for the next class in the Fall.</p>

        <h3>Do I have to live in Anchorage?</h3>
        <p>No -- this program is completely remote. We will participate in weekly voice/video calls with students from around the state. So you can live anywhere in Alaska, as long as you have fast enough internet or good enough cell service to participate in a voice or video call.</p>

        <h3>Do I have to already have an idea?</h3>
        <p>This cirriculum is meant to explore real problems from real customers, and to figure out what solution opportunities exist. If you have an idea already, that is good start, but still, chances are it will change througout this program. That said, it would be helpful if you at least knew what customers you want to help from the beginning. You can always narrow down into exactly how you can help later.</p>

        <h3>What happens if my idea is a complete failure?</h3>
        <p>Welcome to the club! Just by pure statistics, chances are that your idea is not going to be perfect. You expect to tweak it during this process. That said, if you find out that you are completely off base, you can either decide to start over and catch back up, or drop out and re-apply for the Fall 2018 course.</p>

        <p>Such is the startup life: <b>fail fast; fail forward.</b></p>
